Ceph is a distributed object store and file system designed to provide
excellent performance, reliability and scalability.

* Object Storage
  Ceph provides seamless access to objects using native language bindings
  or radosgw, a REST interface that\xe2\x80\x99s compatible with applications
  written for S3 and Swift.
* Block Storage
  Ceph's RADOS Block Device (RBD) provides access to block device images
  that are striped and replicated across the entire storage cluster.
   * File System
  Ceph provides a POSIX-compliant network file system that aims for high
  performance, large data storage, and maximum compatibility with legacy
  applications.

I started looking into Ceph, because the HAST solution with CARP and
ggate did not really do what I was looking for. But I'm aiming for
running a Ceph storage cluster of storagenodes that are running ZFS.
Endstation would be running bhyve on RBD disk that are stored in Ceph.

The FreeBSD build will build most of the tools in Ceph.
